# Helmet Safety Detection using YOLOv10 and Streamlit

This project demonstrates helmet safety detection in images using the YOLOv10 object detection model, deployed with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Overview

The application uses a pre-trained YOLOv10 model to detect helmets in uploaded images. Detected helmets are annotated and displayed back to the user. Streamlit is used to create the web application interface, making it accessible via a web browser.

## Features

- **Upload Image:** Users can upload an image containing individuals wearing helmets.
- **Detection:** The YOLOv10 model detects helmets in the uploaded image.
- **Annotation:** Detected helmets are annotated on the image and displayed to the user.
- **User Interface:** Simple and intuitive web interface provided by Streamlit.
